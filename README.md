## Description

The idea for this project was inspired by my experience in a startup called 'Book Lovers'. I was looking for something to make the insertion of books easier for users and something that could limit error in the insertion of the ISBN code.

## How To Use

Once you're in the web app, click on the 'scan book' button and a little GSAP animation will make the scanner pup out.  
Make sure to fit the barcode in the video box and wait for the code to be inserted in the input field.  
Now click on add book and, if the ISBN code matches any code in the Open Library database, the book will be added to your list!
